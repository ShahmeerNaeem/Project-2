# **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Heart Disease UCI Dataset**

This project focuses on performing an in-depth exploratory data analysis of the **Heart Disease UCI Dataset** to uncover insights about heart disease risks. The analysis includes both statistical exploration and visualizations to highlight key trends and patterns.

## **Project Highlights**

### **Dataset Summary**
- **Rows:** 303  
- **Columns:** 14  
- **Missing Values:** 0  

### **Key Insights**
1. **Demographics:**  
   - The age range of patients is **29–77**, with a gender distribution that skews more **male**.
2. **Health Metrics:**  
   - **Average resting blood pressure:** ~131 mmHg  
   - **Average cholesterol level:** ~247 mg/dL  
   - **Patients with exercise-induced angina:** 99  
3. **Target Variable:**  
   - **165** patients have heart disease.  
   - **138** patients do not have heart disease.

### **Visual Analysis**
- **Age Distribution:** Most patients are aged between **50–60**.  
- **Cholesterol Levels:** Slightly higher in patients with heart disease.  
- **Chest Pain Type:** Analysis reveals significant patterns in heart disease prediction.

## **Code Overview**

This analysis was performed using **Python** and the following libraries:  
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and calculations.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating insightful visualizations.

## **Questions Addressed**
1. How many patients have heart disease, and how many don’t?  
2. What is the age range and gender distribution of patients?  
3. How do cholesterol and blood pressure vary across patients?  
4. Are there any outliers in critical features?  
5. What are the relationships between health metrics and heart disease?  

---

## **Visualizations**

The analysis includes:  
- **Histograms** for age distribution.  
- **Box Plots** comparing cholesterol levels between patients with and without heart disease.  
- **Count Plots** for categorical features like chest pain type and exercise-induced angina.

## **Learnings and Next Steps**

This project enhanced my skills in **data visualization**, **statistical analysis**, and handling **health-related datasets**.  

**Future Steps:**  
Building **predictive models** to identify patients at risk of heart disease based on these insights.
